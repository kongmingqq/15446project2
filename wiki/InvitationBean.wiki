#summary Description of the InvitationBean class

= InvitationBean =

The InvitationBean is a class containing the information about an invitation. The bean is used for client-server communication, and either end can create an Invitation object from an InvitationBean and vice-versa. So far, InvitationBean contains the following data:

  * *int sender* - an int identifier representing the user who created the invitation
  * *int[] inviteList* - an array of identifiers for the users who are invited
  * *int id* - a unique identifier for the invitation
  * *float timeout* - the amount of time before the invitation becomes active. If timeout < 0, then the user did not specify a timeout when the invitation was created, and a default value will be used instead
  * *boolean active* - true if this is an "active" event, false otherwise
  * *String[] data* - additional data used by the Invitation class to reconstruct the invitation
