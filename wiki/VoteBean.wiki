#summary Description of the VoteBean class

= VoteBean =

A VoteBean is sent by a user to the server whenever a user votes on an invitation. The server can then call the addVote method on the relevant Invitation, and the voting information contained in the VoteBean will be added.

A VoteBean is also sent from the server to all users once the invitation times out. For this, the Invitation class contains a method called getVotingInfo, which returns a VoteBean that can be sent to all the users.
